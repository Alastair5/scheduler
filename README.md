# Interview Scheduler

A React based single page application (SPA). Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database. The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format. As this is a demo application, reseting the DB will randomize the data in the API. Jest tests are used through the development of the project.

The app has the following dependencies.

* Axios
* React
* Webpack, Babel
* Sass
* Nodejs
* Express
* Postgresql
* Storybook, Webpack Dev Server, Jest, Testing Library, Cypress
